            <p class="about-me">I am an animal lover. I am passionate about the environment and preserving it. I thrive
                working in an environment that motivates me. I care about people. I am an artist,
                and a writer and know that I can use my creative edge to further advance a company.
                I am confident in my work. I believe that there needs to be more females and people of color in tech spaces.
                I bring the most to my work environment; I believe powerfully
                in representing myself.</p>
